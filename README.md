# SAT-Solver

- Designed a backtracking algorithm in C++ to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given
Boolean formula
- Customized the algorithm to be multi-threaded for the program to execute faster
- Tested the functionality using files in DIMACS format to ensure the program met the specifications
