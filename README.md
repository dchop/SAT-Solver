# SAT-Solver
Implemented a backtracking algorithm in C++ to determine if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given boolean formula. Customized the algorithm to be multi-threaded for the program to execute faster. Tested the functionality using files in DIMACS format to ensure the program met the specifications.

## How to Run
```
# Clean and build executable
$ make
# Run the executable with desired option(s) (ex. ./bin/myls -R -il)
$ ./solver
```
